This repository contains an [Rmarkdown page](https://lexiebsturm.github.io/mcavDispersionBufferExtraction/) detailing a DNA extraction protocol optimized for difficult to extract coral species like *Montastraea cavernosa*. This species is known for harboring high levels of digestion and PCR inhibitors so this protocol incorporates multiple cleaning steps to help with this issue. Although it is relatively time consuming it appears to yield high-quantity and high-quality DNA that could not be isolated through the use of commercial kits or other protocols.
